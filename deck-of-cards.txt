Deck of Cards
-------------

Create a framework that models a generic deck of cards, with the following
behaviors:

  * Should contain an operation named Shuffle() that shuffles this deck
    randomly.
  * Should contain an operation called GetNextCard() that returns the next
    card from the deck
  * GetNextCard() should signal an error when the entire deck has been dealt
    out
  * A call to Shuffle() should cause all cards to be put back in the deck

Using this framework, create a class to model a standard deck of 52 playing
cards that contain 4 suits of 13 cards each.

Include a README as part of your solution and explain:

  * your design decisions
  * how you resolved any ambiguity in the instructions
  * how you would determine that your framework is working correctly for the
    deck of playing cards

Additionally, if youâ€™ve been asked to solve this assignment in a compiled
language, please include Makefile or something suitable that can be used
to compile your code, with instructions in the README.
