Deck of Cards 

I decided to create an inner class called Card within my class called Deck so that I could initialize cards 
and set the proper attributes (facevalue, value, and suit). The instiaters are private because no other class should be able to
initialize Cards except the Deck when its created. All of the methods in the Deck class are private and nonstatic because no other 
class should need to use them and each method should be called by a Deck object. There was no real ambiguity in the instructions; they were
very clear. I tested my code by writing some code in the main method that tests if the deck is being populated correctly, whether its
being shuffled correctly and throwing errors correctly. 

To see that this deck works, simply, in terminal, run
